# OntoMI — An Ontology for Multiple Intelligences in Explanatory Texts

**OntoMI** is a domain ontology (OWL 2, Turtle) developed in a Master’s dissertation to represent how explanatory fragments of educational texts evoke **Multiple Intelligences (MI)**.  
The project began as a prototypical artifact built with **Ontology Development 101** and was **evolved under SABiOx** to a mature, documented, and interoperable ontology **grounded on BFO 2020** and **IAO (OBO Foundry)**.

---

## What is OntoMI?

OntoMI models:
- **ExplanationFragment** — the textual unit of analysis (sentence/paragraph).
- **ExplanationElement** *(abstract)* with three specializations used as evidence:
  - **Keyword**, **ContextObject**, **DiscursiveStrategy**.
- **Intelligence** — the MI categories.
- **IntelligenceActivation** — the reified activation event inferred for a fragment.

The ABox may store **per-intelligence scores** and a derived **MI vector**:
- `onto:hasActivationScore` (functional) — score per intelligence activation.
- `onto:miVector` — 8-position vector (percentages), derived from scores.

---

## Why BFO/IAO?

OntoMI is **founded on BFO 2020** (ISO/IEC 21838-2) and reuses **IAO**:
- Clear separation of **occurrents** (e.g., `IntelligenceActivation`) and **information content entities** (e.g., `ExplanationFragment`).
- OBO-style annotations for definitions, provenance, and editor notes.
- Interoperability and reuse across the OBO/BFO ecosystem.

## Where it comes from (Master’s)

The ontology, rationale, and evaluation (competency questions, instances, and queries) were produced as part of a Master’s dissertation in Informatics in Education, focusing on **heuristic inference** of MI from explanatory discourse.

---

## How it works (in brief)

1. **Model (TBox)**  
   Classes and properties represent fragments, evidence elements, MI categories, and activations; axioms are aligned to BFO/IAO.

2. **Population (ABox)**  
   Text fragments are instantiated with evidence elements. Heuristic rules (external to the OWL TBox) or analytics compute activations and **scores**; the optional **`onto:miVector`** materializes the 8 MI percentages.

3. **Query/Validation**  
   SPARQL queries cover competency questions CQ1–CQ3; integrity checks verify disjointness, domains/ranges, and functional properties.

## Quick start

1. **Open in Protégé**  
   Load `ontology/src/OntoMI.ttl`. Verify consistency with HermiT/ELK.

2. **Explore core CQs**  
   See `docs/competency-questions.md` and run queries from `examples/queries/`.

3. **Inspect BFO/IAO alignment**  
   See `docs/bfo-alignment.md` for the anchoring of OntoMI classes and properties.

4. **Use the scoring & vector**  
   Populate `onto:hasActivationScore` for each activation; optionally emit the 8-slot `onto:miVector` as a derived summary.
